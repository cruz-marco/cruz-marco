## Hello, I'm Marco, nice to meet you!

Today, I can make **data analysys**, **data base management**, develop and evaluate **supervised** and **unsupervised machine learning models** under the **CRISP-DM** framework.

I also make some **back-end** and **front-end** coding, you can see some on my repositories.


Challenge is what drives me.
