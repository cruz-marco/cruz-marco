## Hello, I'm Marco, nice to meet you!

I'm a developer from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, with a passion for technology since always and an assiduous student about it.

When I was in college, I've saw a lot of value in data and decided to have a specialization in this subject. 

Today, I can make **data analysys**, **data base management**, develop and evaluate **supervised** and **unsupervised machine learning models** under the **CRISP-DM** framework.

I also make some **back-end** and **front-end** coding, you can see some on my repositories.


Challenge is what drives me.
